# Multi-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Anatomical-Landmark-Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a novel Capsule Network-based Framework for anatomical landmark detection in medical images. The project leverages capsule networks to detect key anatomical markers in 3D brain MRI and fetal ultrasound images with improved accuracy and robustness.

The proposed system demonstrates significant advancements over traditional methods, showcasing its potential in automating medical image analysis.

This project is built upon the code from [Communicative Reinforcement Learning Agents for Landmark Detection in Brain Images](https://github.com/kundaMwiza/fMRI-site-adaptation](https://github.com/gml16/rl-medical)
